WORLD POPULATION MONITORING
The World Population Monitoring Organisation needs an application
to help keeping track of countriesâ€™ populations. Each Country has a
unique name, the continent it belongs to (may be Europe, America,
Africa, Australia and Asia) and a population (stored in millions). The
employees of the organisation need the application to help them in
the following ways:

  a. The application must allow adding, deleting or updating a
    country. Updating must also consider the case of migration: a
    given number of people leave one country to migrate in another.
    
  b. The application should offer the possibility to display all the countries whose names contain a
    given string (if the string is empty, all the countries should be considered).
    
  c. The application should allow displaying all the countries on a given continent (if the continent is
    empty, all states should be considered), whose populations are greater than a given value, sorted
    ascending by population.
    
  d. The application must provide multiple undo and redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the
    previous operation performed by the user.
